# spurious-correlation-monte-carlo
An Monte Carlo simulation study investigating the fundamental statistical problem of Spurious Correlation and Type I Error rates in high-dimensional data analysis. This project empirically demonstrates the probability of accidentally finding highly significant correlation strengths （|r| > 0.4 &amp; |r| > 0.5）between 10000 truly independent variables.
